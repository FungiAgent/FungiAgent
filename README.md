## Fungi App

The Fungi App allows its users to create and manage Smart Contract Accounts (SCAs) in an interface focused on DeFi operations. Our UI allows SCA owners to perform all basic transaction types typical of a crypto wallet such as receive funds, transfer ETH or ERC20s, holding NFTs, and transfer ownership. Besides this, the user will have a number of tools to facilitate the interaction with DeFi and thus get a yield over their own assets, e.g. build an investment portfolio, provide liquidity, perform long and short operations with GMX, etc.

The Fungi Wallet uses Alchemy's Account Kit to create the SCAs, to be more concrete, the implementation being used is the Light Account, which has gone through security audits, and supports a variety of functionalities that makes for a great developer and user experience.


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
